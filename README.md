# Introduction to Data Visualization in Python
## A DataCamp project
**Objective:** Extends existing Python skills to provide a stronger foundation in data visualization in Python. Obtain a broader coverage of the Matplotlib library and an overview of seaborn, a package for statistical graphics. Topics covered include:
- customizing graphics
- plotting two-dimensional arrays (like pseudocolor plots, contour plots, and images)
- statistical graphics (like visualizing distributions and regressions)
- working with time series and image data
